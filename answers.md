The command git --help gives the needed command to get help on specific issue.
It gave me the command to add the Readme.md and answers.md as a file. And the both show red.
The README.md turned green while the answers.md was still red.
They both shows green since they both have been added.
It says it has nothing to commit, because it is an initial commit not a complete commit.
It gave me the commit, the head, the author and the date the commit was made and the type of the commit command I did issue.
It says it on the branch main and that my branch is up to date.
It wasn't showing .
It shows modified and it got recorded in my files.
Yeah it was.
it show the git-lab2 file.
